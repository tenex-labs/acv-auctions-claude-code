# Plan: two reviewable increments

<!--
Complete this outline in M3 using Plan Mode. Maximum 400 words. No application changes belong in this phase.
The m3 check verifies structure: sections present, every AC mapped to an increment/file/check,
estimate ranges present, subagent fields filled and cited paths existing.
-->

## Kind of change

<!-- Defect correction / new behavior / restructuring / repeated change / prototype — and what that implies for verification. -->

## Alternatives considered

<!-- At least: reuse the prepared job service vs. replace it. Say why the chosen approach wins against the actual code. -->

## Increment A — start work and show progress (M4)

<!-- Ordered changes, files, and the check that proves it: npm run check -- --stage m4 -->

## Increment B — recover from failure (M4)

<!-- Ordered changes, files, the regression case that exposes the stuck-state defect, and the check: npm run check -- --stage m5 -->

## Acceptance mapping

<!-- Columns: ID | Increment (A or B) | File(s) | Check (test or command). -->

| ID | Increment | File(s) | Check |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AC-01 | | | |
| AC-02 | | | |
| AC-03 | | | |
| AC-04 | | | |
| AC-05 | | | |
| AC-06 | | | |

## Change estimate

<!-- Ranges, not exact numbers. Estimation accuracy is unscored; the reasoning is. -->

- Application code: <!-- e.g. 120–180 lines --> lines
- Tests: <!-- e.g. 40–80 lines --> lines
- Styles and automation: <!-- range, including zero when none --> lines
- Total counted code: <!-- application + tests + styles/automation, additions plus deletions, at most 500 --> lines
- Files expected to change: <!-- list -->
- Anything outside the suggested area and why: <!-- or "none" -->

## Subagent investigation

<!-- The bounded question you gave report-investigator, and what you did with the answer. -->

- Question:
- Tools:
- Model:
- Finding: <!-- summarize with the citations it returned (path:line) -->
- Verification: <!-- what you checked yourself to confirm or correct it -->
- Effect on plan:
